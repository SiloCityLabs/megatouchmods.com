We created this page so that everyone can download and find any documents needed to Megatouch hardware. Please share!

Create a tutorial on how to repair/upgrade a motherboard, lcd, or any component and we will [add it to our website](https://github.com/SiloCityLabs/megatouchmods.com). Must be in pdf format and should include many images if possible.

Just my way of giving back to the hobby and the community. Anyone can make an edit to the new site on github, the old site is slowly being moved over to this one. You can still [visit the old site](https://old.megatouchmods.com) while we finish migrating.
